                The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) came into being with
                effect from 6th January 1976 under a separate Act of the State
                Legislature viz. the BDA Act 1976. This Authority combined in
                itself the Planning functions of the City Planning Authority and
                the developmental functions of the erstwhile CITB.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bangalore Development Authority came into existence in 1976
                as a successor to the erstwhile City Improvement Trust Board.
                Development of Bangalore in a planned manner, creating quality
                infrastructure, provision of sites and services and catering to
                the housing needs of the underprivileged are the focus areas of
                the BDA.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since inception, the BDA has allotted 76,000 sites to
                individuals for construction of residential dwellings. In
                addition, more than 800 civic amenity sites have been given for
                use by various public utilities, as also organisations, catering
                to the felt needs of the particular locality.
              </p>
              <p>
                B.D.A. Cadre and Recruitment Rules have been revised and sent to
                Government for approval during April 2001.
